#  Todos App - Redux

In this week's project, it's time to flex your redux muscles and build an application that pulls together all the parts of redux by building a to do app.

## Requirements

- Your app should list all tasks - completed or uncompleted.

- You should be able to mark an uncompleted task as complete (and change it back to uncompleted).

- You should be able to add and remove tasks.

- Your app should show a count of either all tasks or all uncompleted tasks (or both).

## Stretch goals

### Intermediate
- Add a timestamp for each task indicating when it was created. The timestamp should be displayed as a formatted date but stored as a raw date. You can either use built-in JS functionalities or a library like [date-fns](https://www.npmjs.com/package/date-fns).

- Add a **complete all** button to set all tasks as completed. You could also use this opportunity to make your app look nice when there's no data. SeeÂ [empty states UX design](https://www.toptal.com/designers/ux/empty-state-ux-design)Â for some ideas.

- Use styled components instead of vanilla CSS to do your styling.

- Add a box to the side where the completed tasks will be moved to once they are checked, at uncheck- move back to tasklist of unchecked.

### Advanced

- Add a date input to your new task form to set a due date on a task. It could be required, or optional - it's up to you. You could then display this in the list and style it differently when a task is overdue.

- Add filters to display completed/uncompleted tasks, tasks created after a given date or anything else you consider important.


  #### Hint
  Often, when approaching things like this in redux, it's common to use the redux store to save the current filter and dispatch actions to change it. You can then use that state in your selector to decide what todos to return from the selector.
    

- Create categories/tags for tasks so they can be grouped - for example, 'Housework', 'Shopping', etc.

- Create projects for tasks â†’ A project could be a group of tasks which all need to be completed and when they are completed, the project is marked as complete.

## Getting started ðŸ¤“

In your to do app, you should be able to add tasks, list tasks and toggle whether a task is done or not.

You're free to style your to do list however you'd like, but try to keep it simple and clean - remember prospective employers will probably be interested to see this project!

### Hints and tips to complete the project

As always, start by sketching out what your app will look like and how you'd like to use components. Now we're using Redux, you can very easily break things into many small, manageable components.

Once you have your sketch, think about how the data in your store should look. What data does a task contain? Sketch it out and get it clear in your head. Knowing how your data will look will help a lot when writing the redux actions and then using that data in your components.

Then you're ready to start working on the project. None of the Redux packages you need are installed yet, so you'll need to do that yourself:

      npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux

When starting to write your code, try to work on the project in small chunks rather than taking on too much at once. For example, you could start by making a new slice to store your tasks and use a hardcoded list of tasks to get up and running with.

Here is an example slice you could create to store your tasks:


      // src/reducers/tasks.js
      import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

      export const tasks = createSlice({
        name: 'tasks',
        initialState: [
          { id: 1, text: 'Watch video on actions & reducers', complete:   true },
          { id: 2, text: 'Follow redux codealong', complete: true },
          { id: 3, text: 'Fork weekly assignment', complete: true },
          { id: 4, text: 'Create a todo app', complete: false },
        ]
      })

Once you've made your first slice, use `combineReducers` and `configureStore` to create a store in App.js which can be passed to a `Provider` as shown in the codealong.

Here is how you can set up your store to be passed to the provider:

        // src/App.jsx
        import { Provider } from 'react-redux'
        import { combineReducers, configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
        import { tasks } from './reducers/tasks'

        const reducer = combineReducers({
          tasks: tasks.reducer
        })

        const store = configureStore({ reducer })

        export const App = () => {
          return (
            <Provider store={store}>
              Your components can be mounted here, inside the Provider.
            </Provider>
          )
        }


With all that set up, you can now start creating components. For example, you could make aÂ `TaskList`Â component that usesÂ `useSelector`Â from the 'react-redux' package to fetch the list of todos and map over them.

Once you have your todos being listed, it's much easier to see actions you start creating working or not! A good next step is to implement some form ofÂ `addTask`Â action in theÂ `tasks`Â reducer which willÂ `push`Â a new task into the array of hardcoded tasks. You can then set up a form (keep usingÂ `useState`Â to control form elements and then pass the values into your actions on submit).

Another challenge will be giving your checkboxes and/or radio buttons a custom look.
